          <p>Your health data is very important to the NHS. It is shared between doctors, hospitals and dentists for reasons linked to your direct care.</p>
          <p>Your personally identifiable information is also shared beyond your direct care for research and planning purposes. This helps to improve health and social care services for you and your family. The NHS depends on this information to plan essential facilities, like heart units and specialist care wards. The data can also be used in research to improve treatment for serious conditions and disease.</p>

          <h3>Understanding health data</h3>
          <p>
            Whenever you visit an NHS service, we use and update a record of information all about you. This is known as your Summary Care Record (SCR) and contains your patient health information.

          <h3>Sharing your data</h3>
          <p>
            An organisation that collects and uses identifiable information is known as a data controller. NHS Digital is a data controller.

          <h3>Benefits of data sharing</h3>
          <p>
            Your patient health information is shared between doctors, hospitals and dentists for reasons linked to your own direct care. There is also huge potential to use patient health information to improve health and social care services across the NHS.

          <h3>How data is kept secure</h3>

          <h3>How opting out works</h3>
          <p>
            There are some circumstances where opt-outs do not apply and your personally identifiable data will be used regardless. This includes anytime you visit a health or social care professional for your own direct care purposes.

          <h2>Registering your preference</h2>
          <p>You now have the chance to opt-out of sharing your personally identifiable information for purposes beyond your direct care. This means it will not be shared for reasons linked to research or planning.</p>

            <h3>Reducing the length of stay for breast cancer surgery patients</h3>
            <p>Sharing data has many positive effects. The length of time spent in hospital for breast cancer surgery patients dropped massively back in 2012. This was all thanks to relevant data sharing. The average length of hospital stay was reduced by 50 per cent.</p>
