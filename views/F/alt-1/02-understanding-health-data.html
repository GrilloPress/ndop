              <p>Whenever you visit an NHS service, we use and update a record of information all about you. This is known as your Summary Care Record (SCR) and contains your patient health information. This can be seen and used by your GP, your dentist and any hospitals you have visited for treatment.</p>
              <h3>Inside your record</h3>
              <p>Your SCR will contain information about the care you have received. This is really important for health and social care professionals. It provides access to your medical history and important details, like allergies and past operations. This information is used to make careful decisions about your care.</p>
              <h3>Your medical history</h3>
              <p>Your medical history will include both past and on-going treatments. It will also contain any previous x-rays and discharge notes. The medicine you take, test results and any conditions you have will all be available in your record. This will also include personally identifiable data such as your name, age and address.</p>
