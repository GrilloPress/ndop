              <h2>Data controllers</h2>
              <p>An organisation that collects and uses identifiable information is known as a data controller. NHS Digital is a data controller. We have a legal duty to take care of your data and provide details of what is being collected. We will only share your information for very specific reasons.</p>
              <p>We only give access to personally identifiable information if:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>it will be used to promote health and care services</li>
                <li>the organisation will look after the data in accordance with law and good practice for Information Governance (IG)</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Completely confidential</h2>
              <p>Your information is captured safely and securely. It is then stored by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) operating as NHS Digital.</p>
              <p>All data is stored in accordance with the Health &amp; Social Care Act (2012) and Health &amp; Social Care Act (2014) and in agreement with the Data Protection Act (1998). You have the right to obtain information from the HSCIC if you want to know how data is stored and used.</p>
              <h2>Request for information</h2>
              <p>Certain organisations can request access to health and care data. If released, this information must be used to support the delivery of health and social care services in England.</p>
              <p>Your data can be used in research and planning to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>improve medicines and treatments</li>
                <li>prevent illness and serious diseases</li>
                <li>organise and arrange care services</li>
                <li>prepare for health emergencies and epidemics</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Legal contracts</h2>
              <p>Before any data can be released, a legal contract must be signed between NHS Digital and the organisation requesting information. This states the rules on what an organisation can do with shared data. It also contains clear limits on what cannot be done and what is forbidden.</p>
              <p>A legal contract for data sharing will include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>the type of data being shared</li>
                <li>how the data is being shared</li>
                <li>the purpose for sharing data</li>
                <li>a date for when the data must be destroyed</li>
                <li>all other data security conditions</li>
              </ul>
              <p>An organisation cannot link this information with any other data, or use the data to re-identify a patient in any way. The information will never be sent to a third-party organisation or used for marketing purposes. An organisation may also be audited to ensure data is used appropriately.</p>
