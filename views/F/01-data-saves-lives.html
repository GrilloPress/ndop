    <h2>Data Saves Lives</h2>
    <p>Your health data is very important to the NHS. It is shared between doctors, hospitals and dentists for reasons linked to your direct care.</p>
    <p>Your personally identifiable information is also shared beyond your direct care for research and planning purposes. This helps to improve health and social care services for you and your family. The NHS depends on this information to plan essential facilities, like heart units and specialist care wards. The data can also be used in research to improve treatment for serious conditions and disease.</p>
    <h2>Registering your preference</h2>
    <p>You now have the chance to opt-out of sharing your personally identifiable information for purposes beyond your direct care. This means it will not be shared for reasons linked to research or planning.</p>
    <p>Use this online service to register your preferences for sharing your patient data. By sharing your data you can contribute to the health of future generations.</p>
